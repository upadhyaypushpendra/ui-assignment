The teacher is excellent and really knows how to connect with kids and teach them no matter their age or developmental level. My 3 year old has enjoyed the classes and the worksheets as well. It works well for parents also since the classes are just twice a week. The small batch size also ensures that the teacher is constantly interacting with the kids so your child is always engaged. I couldn't be happier with how this program has worked out for my child! Big thumbs up from my side! ​",
